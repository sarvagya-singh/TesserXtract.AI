"""
This Flask application leverages OCR and regular expressions to seamlessly extract valuable information from image files. Key technical features include:

- OCR Engine Integration: Employs Tesseract, a robust open-source OCR engine, to accurately extract text from uploaded image files.
- Text Extraction and Data Framing: Transforms extracted text into structured JSON format, making it readily consumable for further analysis or integration with other systems.
- Precise Field Extraction: Utilizes meticulously crafted regular expressions to pinpoint and isolate specific fields of interest, streamlining data retrieval.
- Multiprocessing Capabilities: Enhances efficiency by supporting concurrent processing of multiple image uploads, enabling users to process larger batches of files effectively.

Additional Technical Considerations:

- Python Foundation: Built upon the versatile Python programming language, known for its extensive libraries and readability.
- Flask Framework: Utilizes the lightweight and flexible Flask web framework for streamlined web application development.
- Error Handling: Incorporates robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage potential file upload issues, OCR processing errors, or invalid field extraction scenarios.
- Asynchronous Processing: Explores integration with asynchronous task queues for further performance optimization, especially when handling large-scale image uploads or computationally intensive OCR tasks.

Example Usage:
- Upload a file to the Flask application.
- The file is processed using OCR and regular expressions to extract field values.
- The extracted field values are returned as JSON.

Example input:
- File: invoice.png

Example output:
{
  "fields": {
    "invoice.png": {
      "GSTIN": "ABCD1234",
      "Invoice Number": "INV-001",
      "Invoice Date": "01 Jan 2022",
      ...
    }
  }
}

Inputs:
- File(s) to be uploaded and processed by the Flask application.

Flow:
1. The Flask application is created and configured.
2. The `/upload` route is defined to handle file uploads.
3. The uploaded files are checked for validity (image file and size limit).
4. The files are saved to the `UPLOAD_FOLDER` directory with unique filenames.
5. The files are processed using multiprocessing, where each file is passed to the `process_file` function.
6. The `process_file` function performs OCR on the image file and extracts field values using regular expressions.
7. The extracted field values are returned along with the filename.
8. The extracted field values and filenames are stored in a dictionary.
9. The dictionary is returned as JSON response.

Outputs:
- JSON response containing the extracted field values and filenames.
