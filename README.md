- **OCR Integration:** Leverages Tesseract, a powerful open-source OCR engine, to accurately extract text from images.
- **Field Extraction:** Precisely isolates specific fields of interest using meticulously crafted regular expressions.
- **JSON Output:** Delivers extracted field values in a structured JSON format, promoting compatibility with downstream applications.
- **Multiprocessing:** Optimizes performance by concurrently processing multiple image uploads, enhancing efficiency.

## **Technical Highlights**

- **Python:** Built upon the versatile Python programming language.
- **Flask:** Utilizes the lightweight Flask web framework for streamlined development.
- **Tesseract:** Integrates the robust Tesseract OCR library.
- **Regular Expressions:** Harnesses the power of regular expressions for accurate field extraction.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully manages potential errors for smooth operation.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Explores asynchronous task queues for further performance optimization (in development).

## **Installation and Setup**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Python 3.x
   - Tesseract OCR (install separately)
   - Required Python libraries (listed in requirements.txt)
2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
   - `python -m venv venv`
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
     - Linux/macOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. **Clone TesserXtract.AI:**
   - Clone the repository:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/giruu/TesserXtract.AI.git
   ```
   Navigate to the cloned directory:
   
   ```bash
   cd TesserXtract
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## **Running the Application**

1. **Start the Flask development server:**
   - `flask run`
2. **Access the application:**
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (or the specified port)

## **Usage**

1. **Upload images:** Use the file upload interface to select multiple image files.
2. **View results:** The extracted field values will be displayed in JSON format.


## **Additional Information**

- **Error Handling:** The application incorporates error handling for file uploads, OCR processing, and field extraction.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Asynchronous task queues are being explored to further optimize performance, especially for large-scale image processing.
